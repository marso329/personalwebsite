                            I just finished my master thesis at the world renounced CERN research organization which is titled
                            ”Online Transverse Beam Instability Detection in the LHC”. It mixes several different research field
                            such as high-energy particle accelerators physics, digital signal processing, and parallel program-
                            ming. This was required since an understanding of transverse instabilities in particle accelerators
                            was required to fully analyze them together with knowledge on how to process the raw data ac-
                            quired from the LHC. To handle the vast amount of data, a knowledge about parallel computing
                            was required. I deeply enjoy mixing knowledge from different fields and putting them all together
                            in a product which can help other people in their jobs, life or personal projects. Together with my
                            thesis, I created a system that could detect instabilities in the LHC which generates a hardware
                            trigger that observation equipment around the LHC listens to. This allows observation buffers to
                            be stored for later analysis by physicists at CERN. I also created a fixed display in the control room
                            which allows the operators to monitor the transverse activity in real-time.

                            I have been at CERN for a bit over a year and during this time I have developed the instability de-
                            tection system, written my thesis and developed a system for long spectrum analysis of the beam
                            position. I have also developed a system for general data buffer acquisition and compression, a sys-
                            tem for data extraction on post-mortem event in the LHC and a control system which allows the
                            transverse feedback system of the LHC to be used for exciting the beam. When I am not working I
                            spend most of my time working on private programming projects, snowboarding and motorbiking.

                            My field of expertise is parallel computing but I do enjoy learning new traits. I enjoy working with
                            electronics and mechanical engineering. During my time at university, I was a part of a mechanical
                            engineering club where I learned how to weld, mill and lathe. This allowed me to be a TA in a few
                            design courses 2 where I helped students with both their designs and manufacturing. I was also a
                            part of the formula student team where I was vice president and chief of the electronics team. The goal of the formula student team
                            is to design and manafacture a small racecar during one year and then compete at Silverstone, England. I was a part of this team for two years where I
                            both led the team-members in my role as vice-president but also developed electronics as my role as head of electronics. This was a valuable experience and I learnt alot during this period. We managed to design and manafacture two cars and have them race at Silverstone.

                            I have always enjoyed teaching and I had the privilege to construct a project for a course 4 in in-
                            troductory programming. The goal of the project was to give the students a life-like situation where
                            they were given a contract to design a product for a client. In my project, their goal was to design
                            a robotic dog. The received a Lego EV3 kit with used a custom Linux kernel which I had prepared
                            for them together with a Python API which allowed them to remotely control all motors and read
                            values from the sensors. The first part of the course was to do some exercises which I had created
                            for them and then create a guard dog that would patrol a room. The feedback was great and most
                            students really enjoyed the course. I was supervising 36 students in groups of 3 people. During
                            this course I introduced students to GUI programming, debugging, object-oriented programming
                            and code versioning tools to name a few.
